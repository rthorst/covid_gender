High-level plan.

TODO NEXT: figure out how you can test gender difference in social distancing
as an explanation for covid.

1. Do men socially distance less?
    (yes:
    in counties with more men there is less social distancing.
    this internally replicated over 5/5 different days in april
    rho -0.06 - -0.16
    )
2. If so, does this explain different rates of COVID infection?
