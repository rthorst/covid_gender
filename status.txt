High-level plan.

TODO NEXT: figure out how you can test gender difference in social distancing
as an explanation for covid.

1. Do men socially distance less?
    (yes:
    in counties with more men there is less social distancing.
    this internally replicated over 5/5 different days in april
    rho -0.06 - -0.16
    )


2. If so, does this explain different rates of COVID infection?

    Every county has a gender gap in men vs. women
    It also has a behavior gap in men vs. women (distancing).

    Are these correlated?
    That is, in areas where men socially distance less, is there also a 
    gap in infections?

    Thus I need:
    --> Data (the most granular I can get) about COVID by sex.
