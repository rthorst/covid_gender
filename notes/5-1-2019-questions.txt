Gender is a winner here. 
Men are more likely than women to (A) contract coronavirus (B) die from it.

While this could be thought of as biological, it could also be behavioral. 

We know men take loads of risks in other domains. Maybe men are going out and taking 
more risks.

We can test this because we have social distaincing by census block, and we can impute
gender across the different census blocks.

===============================================================================

1. Are there places that are currently open now but not safely? To put more of a
point on it, we have been allowing parks to open. Are we achieving a safe capacity, there?

    We have visits by hour to places in the weekly-patterns dataset.
    Can we find unsafe hours?

2. We are currently arguing how to re-open safely. Can you show a way that it can be done?
One thing we can do is to sort places by baseline traffic. 

3. If you start locally -- in Cary -- where are people going? 

4. Men are more likely than women to get the coronavirus and to die from it. Why?

    I think it's BEHAVIORAL not BIOLOGICAL. Men are GOING OUT more in 
    RISKY WAYS.

    I could test it: for each census block I know the gender and how good social
    distancing is.

Can I predictively tell when an outbreak will occur, stop?

Could you micro-police, where you drive different policies for different areas?
What might make a difference?

Which places, as currently open NOW, are unsafe? How good are we at having social distancing
in the grocery store, for example?


1. What time can I go to ....?
2. What are people spending their money on, now?
3. How often are people going out, and where are they going?
4. Does stay-at-home work?

1. When is it safe to go to the X? E.g. what time?
2. What is the impact of the new Georgia re-opening?


What makes people stay at home right now? Is it political?
